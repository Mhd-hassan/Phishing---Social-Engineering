Problem Statement:

[PKPCS01] Phishing & Social Engineering Attacks: With the rise of AI-generated scams, 
how can users be better protected from phishing and social engineering threats? 

Explanation:

In today’s digital age, cybercriminals are using AI to create highly convincing scams that target unsuspecting users. Phishing and social engineering attacks exploit human psychology—curiosity, urgency, or trust—to trick individuals into sharing sensitive information like passwords, banking details, or personal data.

AI-generated scams have made these attacks more sophisticated, making it increasingly difficult for users to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent content. This raises the risk of identity theft, financial loss, and data breaches.

The challenge lies in empowering users to recognize and defend against these threats. Effective solutions may involve AI-driven detection systems, real-time warning tools, or educational resources that help users identify and avoid malicious attempts before any harm occurs.
